[TASK]
Analyze news for {symbol} and generate 7 precise features predicting next trading day price movement.
Each feature must be an integer value: -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2.
Scale: -2 (very negative) | -1 (negative) | 0 (no impact) | 1 (positive) | 2 (very positive)

[NEWS DATA]
Recent news articles with significance scores:
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate significance (business developments, operational updates)
- 0.7-1.0: High significance (earnings, major announcements, strategic shifts)
{news}

[SIGNIFICANT NEWS]
High-impact news with detailed analysis:
{significant_news}

[ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES]
1. Material Information Priority: Earnings results, guidance changes, M&A activity > routine announcements
2. Actual vs Expected Analysis: Compare results to consensus estimates - surprises move markets more
3. Forward-Looking Weight: Future guidance and management outlook > historical performance data  
4. Quantitative vs Qualitative: Concrete numbers (EPS, revenue, margins) > vague management statements
5. Market Anomaly Detection: Unusual volume, insider activity, or sector-wide moves amplify individual news impact
6. Fact vs Speculation Distinction: Confirmed announcements > rumors, official sources > speculation

[FEATURE DEFINITIONS]
Generate these 7 features based on collective news impact:
- news_relevance: How directly news affects the stock's business/price (-2: very irrelevant, -1: somewhat irrelevant, 0: neutral/no relevance, 1: somewhat relevant, 2: highly relevant)
- sentiment: Overall positive/negative tone toward the company (-2: very negative, -1: negative, 0: neutral, 1: positive, 2: very positive)
- price_impact_potential: Likely magnitude of price movement tomorrow (-2: strong negative impact, -1: negative impact, 0: no impact, 1: positive impact, 2: strong positive impact)
- trend_direction: Which way the news suggests price will move (-2: strong downward trend, -1: downward trend, 0: neutral/sideways, 1: upward trend, 2: strong upward trend)
- earnings_impact: How news affects future earnings expectations (-2: very negative impact, -1: negative impact, 0: no impact, 1: positive impact, 2: very positive impact)
- investor_confidence: Impact on investor trust and conviction (-2: major confidence decrease, -1: confidence decrease, 0: no change, 1: confidence increase, 2: major confidence increase)
- risk_profile_change: Changes to perceived company risk level (-2: major risk increase, -1: risk increase, 0: no change, 1: risk decrease, 2: major risk decrease)
