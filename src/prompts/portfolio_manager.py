[MARKET DATA ANALYSIS]

Technical Indicators (Price Momentum & Market Sentiment):

Price vs Moving Average: {price_vs_sma}
- Shows current price relationship to 20-day simple moving average
- Indicates short-term trend direction relative to recent average

RSI (Relative Strength Index): {rsi_interpretation}
- Measures momentum on 0-100 scale
- Higher values indicate stronger upward momentum, lower values indicate stronger downward momentum

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): {macd_interpretation}
- Measures relationship between two moving averages
- Signal line crossovers and histogram changes indicate momentum shifts

Bollinger Bands: {bb_interpretation}
- Volatility bands around moving average
- Price position relative to bands indicates volatility and potential reversal points

ADX (Average Directional Index): {adx_interpretation}
- Measures trend strength regardless of direction
- Higher values indicate stronger trends

CCI (Commodity Channel Index): {cci_interpretation}
- Measures cyclical trends and momentum
- Values above +100 or below -100 indicate strong momentum conditions

Fundamental Analysis:
{fundamental_analysis}

[NEWS ANALYSIS - MARKET RISK ASSESSMENT]
These features reflect current market conditions and represent real-time risk factors that can significantly impact price movements, regardless of technical setup:

News Relevance: {news_relevance} (scale: -2 to +2)
- Measures how relevant current news is to the stock
- Higher absolute values indicate more significant potential price impact
- Values reflect the degree of direct business or financial relevance

Overall Sentiment: {sentiment} (scale: -2 to +2)
- Current market sentiment direction from news analysis
- Positive values indicate market optimism and bullish expectations
- Negative values signal pessimism and potential downward pressure

Price Impact Potential: {price_impact_potential} (scale: -2 to +2)
- Expected magnitude of price movement based on current news
- Higher absolute values suggest stronger potential price reactions
- Direction indicates whether impact is likely positive or negative

Trend Direction: {trend_direction} (scale: -2 to +2)
- Directional bias from news analysis
- Positive values suggest news-driven upward momentum
- Negative values indicate potential downward pressure from news events

Earnings Impact: {earnings_impact} (scale: -2 to +2)
- Influence of earnings-related news on market perception
- Positive values reflect strong financial performance or positive outlook
- Negative values indicate disappointing results or concerning guidance

Investor Confidence: {investor_confidence} (scale: -2 to +2)
- Current level of investor confidence based on news sentiment
- Positive values indicate strong market psychology and risk appetite
- Negative values suggest deteriorating confidence and risk aversion

Risk Profile Change: {risk_profile_change} (scale: -2 to +2)
- Change in perceived risk profile from recent news events
- Positive values indicate decreased risk perception and improved outlook
- Negative values suggest heightened risk and increased uncertainty

Multiple aligned news factors in the same direction often compound to create significant market momentum that can reinforce or contradict technical indicators.

{historical_context}

[TRADING DECISION FRAMEWORK]

Signal Logic:
- BUY: When you expect price to rise AND technical momentum supports the move
- SELL: When you expect price to fall AND technical momentum confirms weakness AND news sentiment is negative  
- HOLD: When signals conflict or during trend uncertainty - preservation of capital over missed opportunities

Momentum Confirmation (Required for BUY signals):
- Is current price above 5-day moving average?
- Is MACD histogram improving (becoming less negative or more positive)?
- Are multiple news factors aligned, not just one strong factor?

Trend Analysis Guidelines:
- If MACD histogram negative for 3+ consecutive periods: downtrend active
- If MACD histogram positive for 3+ consecutive periods: uptrend active
- When technical indicators show consistent bearish momentum (negative MACD histogram, declining RSI), positive news sentiment should be weighted more conservatively
- Technical indicators should be weighted more heavily during established trends
- Strong positive news during technical downtrends may represent dead cat bounce rather than reversal

HOLD Guidelines:
- Use HOLD when technical and news signals conflict significantly
- Use HOLD when RSI < 35 (oversold) unless news sentiment is extremely positive (>1.5)
- Use HOLD when MACD histogram has been negative for 5+ consecutive periods
- Default to HOLD during uncertain trend transitions

Position Sizing Rules:
- Base percentage: 10-100% in steps of 10%
- Higher conviction and stronger expected moves warrant larger positions
- Reduce position size by 50% when technical and news signals conflict
- Maximum 30% position size when RSI < 30 or RSI > 70 (extreme conditions)
- Maximum 40% position size when MACD histogram opposite to news sentiment

[OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS]
Based on your analysis of all provided data, generate a trading decision with the following format:

Trading Signal: BUY, SELL, or HOLD (using the decision framework above)

Confidence Level: Decimal between 0.1 and 1.0 (in steps of 0.1)
- Represents your confidence in the price direction prediction
- Higher values indicate stronger conviction in your forecast

Position Size: Integer between 10 and 100 (in steps of 10)
- Percentage of capital to allocate based on conviction and potential profit
